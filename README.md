# Dashboard for Logistic Department
A housing corporation commissioned the creation of this dashboard to better understand and track their performance across the nation. They wanted to see the comparison of successful deliveries to complaints and the performance of constructors by month, location, and logistics employee. The project required a significant effort to gather and analyze the data, as well as coordination with various internal departments of the company to settle privacy agreements and other necessary steps. The project took around three months to complete and it was a challenging task that required a lot of hours of work, as well as a great deal of communication and cooperation with different departments of the company. The end result was a comprehensive and informative dashboard that provided valuable insights into the performance of the corporation, and helped to identify areas that needed improvement. Overall, this project was a success and received positive feedback from the housing corporation and all other stakeholders involved. The corporation was pleased with the project outcome and it helped them to optimize their internal processes and improve their performance. The team's hard work and dedication paid off, as the project was completed on time and within budget. The final product was well received and the corporation was able to use the insights to improve their operations, which in turn led to increase in customer satisfaction.
